#.profile
This is the dotfile '.profile' I'm using.

**Included files**
* Bash (.profile)

##About .profile
'.profile' is a dotfile which I use to customise my system with. It contains the following things:
* Modification of my prompt
* Aliases. These serve as shortcuts to some directories.
* A welcome message, said by a cow.
* A setting to change npm's default directory. This way, my system is able to find npm within my home directory. This will be useful to me when I install more npm code.

##Installing
1. Clone or download the repository. You can do this by using *git clone*.
2. If you haven't already, [install npm here.](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node). You'll only have to go through chapter 2 and 3. Npm is necessary if you want the 'cowsay' configuration to work.
3. [Install cowsay](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cowsay).
4. Edit '.profile' however you want. For example, try changing the cowsay text.
5. Have fun!

##About me
I'm Alyssa Nguyen and I'm a student who is learning how to code. I hope you will find my dotfile useful.
